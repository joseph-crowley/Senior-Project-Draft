\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	As the Large Hadron Collider is shut down for its second upgrade period, the ALICE collaboration has been performing upgrades on detectors and computing systems. Electronics for T0+ were assembled and tested and will be in use in the ALICE cavern during Run 3 of the LHC. Simulations of T0+ will be used to better reconstruct tracks, account for background contributions, and improve multiplicity and centrality resolution of the Fast Interaction Trigger. Some examples of future work based on this project are given at the end of the manuscript, including hardware and software tasks that will introduce students to high-energy physics in an impactful and lasting learning experience.
