abstract = "The performance of the 25μm-pore Planacon MCP-PMT is discussed here and the device is evaluated for the use as the main photosensor of the Cherenkov arrays of the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector for the upgrade of the ALICE apparatus at the CERN LHC. During the LHC Run 3 and 4 FIT has to operate in strong magnetic fields and in large particle fluxes without significant ageing effects. The expected dynamic range for central modules of Cherenkov arrays of FIT is from 1 to ∼1000 MIPs. The required single-MIP time resolution is below 50 ps and the expected average repetition rate is 50 kHz. To fulfil these requests, the Planacon XP85012/A1-Q MCP-PMT has been customized into the XP85002/FIT-Q version. With the modified Planacon we were able to achieve a time resolution as low as 13 ps and ensure good timing of the device under the required dynamic range. A description of the implemented MCP-PMT modifications is presented here together with the outcome of the in-beam test of the assembled Cherenkov module and dedicated ageing- and magnetic field tests."

abstract = "The LHC heavy-ion luminosity and collision rate from 2021 onwards will considerably exceed the design parameters of the present ALICE forward trigger detectors and the introduction of the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) will significantly reduce the space available for the new trigger detectors. To comply with these conditions a new Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) will be built. FIT will be the main forward trigger, luminometer, and interaction-time detector. It will also determine multiplicity, centrality, and reaction plane of heavy-ion collisions. FIT will consist of two arrays of Cherenkov quartz radiators with MCP-PMT sensors and of a plastic scintillator ring. By increasing the overall acceptance of FIT, the scintillator will improve centrality and event plane resolution. It will also add sensitivity for the detection of beam-gas events and provide some degree of redundancy. FIT is currently undergoing an intense R&D and prototyping period. It is scheduled for installation in ALICE during 2020."

The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."
